# Data_Visualization
This project is about to answer several questions that underlying the usage of energy and the 
energy production process:
▪ How much energy a state consumed?
▪ Which state consume the largest amount of energy, and which consume the least?
▪ Is the energy demand increased?
▪ How much energy is generated to supply users demand?
Our ambitions at the completion of the project are:
▪ Learn and have a better understanding about how the energy is conversed and transmitted.
▪ To be aware of energy shortage and energy market.
▪ Find an efficient way to introduce the data and analyze the growth pattern.
The project has well informed us the insight regarding the energy production and consumption. 
Approaching the data and comparing the values each year wake me up on how much the energy 
market has changed, as well as how fast are we growing the country and the economy.

# Data Visualization: Energy Consumption & Production

This project delves into understanding energy usage and production processes. We aim to answer the following key questions:  
- **How much energy does a state consume?**  
- **Which state consumes the largest amount of energy, and which consumes the least?**  
- **Is the demand for energy increasing?**  
- **How much energy is generated to meet user demands?**  

## Ambitions Post-Completion

By the conclusion of this project, we aim to:  
- Gain a deeper understanding of how energy is conserved and transmitted.  
- Raise awareness about energy shortages and the broader energy market.  
- Discover efficient ways to present and analyze data, especially in recognizing growth patterns.  

## Reflections

Engaging with this project has provided us with invaluable insights into energy production and consumption. Analyzing the data and comparing yearly values has shed light on the dynamic changes in the energy market, as well as the rapid growth of both our country and economy.
